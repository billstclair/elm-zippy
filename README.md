In 1985 or thereabouts, I wrote a little program for the Symbolics Lisp Machine that sent Zippy the Pinheads careening across the screen, reflecting off of top and sides, and always facing the left/right direction they were traveling.

This project reproduces that, in a browser, with Elm, with check boxes for the images you want to use, and a fill-in for how many are active at once.
